    <h1>Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript</h1>
    <h3>
      Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the
      building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different
      from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null,
      undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types
      all store a single value each (depending on their types).
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of
      these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. An object, is
      a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are
      given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer
      points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables
      don’t actually store the value.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered
      collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form
      of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are
      called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
      For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name,
      age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an
      object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.
      Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables,
      except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define
      the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object
      with a simple dot-notation: objectName.propertyName Like all JavaScript
      variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and
      property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning
      it a value.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything
      that can be converted to a string, including the empty string. However,
      any property name that is not a valid JavaScript identifier (for example,
      a property name that has a space or a hyphen, or that starts with a
      number) can only be accessed using the square bracket notation. This
      notation is also very useful when property names are to be dynamically
      determined (when the property name is not determined until runtime)
